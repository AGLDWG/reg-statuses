# Concept

## Unstable

`https://linked.data.gov.au/def/reg-statuses/unstable`

An entry that is not seen as having a reasonable measure of stability. This status is expected to be allocated to entries that were once Stable but have become Unstable, due to a management or technical mishap, rather than being allocated to resources before they become Stable. Those resources should be allocated Experimental.
